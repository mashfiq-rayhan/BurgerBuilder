# Burger Builder 🍔

Burger Builder is a full-stack React application that allows users to create custom burgers by adding or removing ingredients, view a real-time price update, and place orders with authentication. The project demonstrates advanced React patterns, Redux for state management, modular component architecture, and integration with backend services for order processing and authentication.

- 💵 Real-time price calculation as ingredients are added or removed
- 🛒 Order summary and checkout process with form validation
- 🔐 User authentication (signup/signin) and protected routes
- 📦 Persistent orders and authentication state using localStorage
- 🗂️ Modular, reusable React components and custom hooks
- ⚛️ State management with Redux and Redux Thunk for async actions
- 📄 Responsive UI with CSS modules and clean design
- 🧪 Unit tests for core components and logic
- 🚀 Optimized build and development workflow with Webpack

## 🏆 Achievements

- 🚀 Built a production-ready React app with a scalable, maintainable codebase
